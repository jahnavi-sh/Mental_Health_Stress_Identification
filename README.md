# Mental_Health_Stress_Identification

### **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting whether an individual is stressed based on textual data. By leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to enhance our understanding of stress-related language patterns, providing valuable insights for mental health professionals and support systems.

### **Libraries Used:**
- **NumPy and Pandas:** Utilized for efficient data manipulation, handling, and processing.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization, generating insights from the dataset.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Leveraged for advanced natural language processing tasks, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.
- **Regular Expressions:** Applied for intricate text cleaning, pattern recognition, and transformation.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Utilized for feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and classification.
- **WordCloud:** Utilized to visualize the most frequently occurring words in the dataset.

### **Data Preprocessing:**
1. **Text Cleaning:** Extensive text cleaning involved removing special characters, URLs, HTML tags, usernames, and non-alphanumeric symbols, ensuring only essential textual content remained.
2. **Tokenization:** The cleaned text was tokenized into individual words, forming the basis for analysis.
3. **Stopword Removal:** Common, non-informative words were removed to focus on relevant content.
4. **Lemmatization:** Words were reduced to their base forms, ensuring consistency and reducing dimensionality.

### **Feature Extraction:**
Two key techniques were employed to transform raw text into machine-readable features:
- **Bag of Words (CountVectorizer):** This method converted text documents into numerical vectors, representing the frequency of each word in the dataset.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** A numerical statistic reflecting the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection, used for feature extraction.

### **Model Training:**
Three diverse machine learning algorithms were employed to train the models, facilitating comparison and selection of the most suitable approach:
- **Logistic Regression:** A linear classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic algorithm widely applied for text classification tasks.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning method known for its robustness and accuracy.

### **Model Evaluation:**
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of the model's performance, displaying true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
- **Classification Report:** Detailed metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, and support, offering comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness.

### **Prediction System:**
The project culminated in a practical applicationâ€”a predictive system capable of classifying new textual input as either stressed or non-stressed. This real-time analysis tool enables prompt responses to emotional distress, benefiting both individuals and support systems.

### **Conclusion:**
This project signifies a significant advancement in automated mental health analysis. By providing individuals, counselors, and mental health professionals with tools to detect stress signs efficiently and accurately, this model contributes substantially to mental health awareness and support systems. The model's reliability and real-time capabilities make it a valuable asset in various contexts, from online mental health platforms to community support services.
